# Introduction

## What?

* Discovering subdomains related to the target organisation
* Gathering publicly available information about a host and IP addresses
* Finding email addresses related to the target
* Discovering login credentials and leaked passwords
* Locating leaked documents and spreadsheets

## Why?

In a red team operation, we might start with no more than a company name, from which we need to start gathering 
information about the target. The more we know about our target's infrastructure and people, the better we can 
orchestrate our attacks.

## How?

Use from these, but choose wisely: be quiet, keep the noise down.
