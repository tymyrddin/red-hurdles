# Introduction

## What?

Threat Intelligence (TI) or Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is the information, or TTPs 
(Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures), attributed to an adversary, commonly used by defenders to aid in detection 
measures. In addition, Indicators of compromise (IoC) can be used.

## Why?

To leverage its information from an offensive perspective to assist in adversary emulation.

## How?

such as:

* [TIBER-EU](tiber-eu.md)
* [MITRE ATT&CK](mitre-attack.md)
* [OST Map](ost-map.md)
