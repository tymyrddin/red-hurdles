Countermeasures are designed to prevent an adversary from detecting critical information, provide an alternative 
interpretation of critical information or indicators (deception), or deny the adversaryâ€™s collection system.

Example: The countermeasure for the vulnerability of running Nmap, using the Metasploit framework, and hosting the 
phishing pages using the same public IP address, seems obvious: Use a different IP address for each activity.

Example: For the vulnerability of an unsecured database used to store data received from a phishing page, ensure 
that the database is adequately secured so that the data cannot be accessed except by authorised people.
