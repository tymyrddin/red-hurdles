# BYOB

[BYOB](https://github.com/malwaredllc/byob) is an open-source post-exploitation framework for students, researchers and developers. It is designed to allow 
students and developers to easily implement their own code and add new features without having to write a C2 server or 
Remote Administration Tool from scratch.
