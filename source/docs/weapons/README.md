# Introduction

## What?

Weaponisation is the second stage of the Cyber Kill Chain model. Use our own crafted tools to exploit a target.

## Why?

Most organisations have Windows OS running, which is going to be a likely target. An organisation's environment 
policy often blocks downloading and executing `.exe` files to avoid security violations. 

Red teams rely on building custom payloads sent via other channels such as phishing campaigns, social engineering, 
browser or software exploitation, USB, or web methods.
