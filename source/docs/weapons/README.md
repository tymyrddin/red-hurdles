# Introduction

## What?

Weaponisation is the second stage of the Cyber Kill Chain model. In this stage, the attacker generates and develops 
their own evil code using deliverable payloads such as word documents, PDFs, etc. The weaponisation stage aims to 
use the weapon to exploit the target machine and gain initial access.

## Why?

Most organisations have Windows OS running, which is going to be a likely target. An organisation's environment 
policy often blocks downloading and executing `.exe` files to avoid security violations. 

Red teams rely on building custom payloads sent via other channels such as phishing campaigns, social engineering, 
browser or software exploitation, USB, or web methods.
