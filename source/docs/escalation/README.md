# Introduction

## What?

Windows presents an enormous attack surface and most companies run Windows hosts, so we will often find ourselves 
gaining access to Windows machines. These are all methods on common real-world misconfigurations and flaws 
in modern and legacy Windows Server and Desktop versions that may be present in a client environment.

## Why?

Elevating privileges will provide more 
options for persistence and may reveal information stored locally that can further our access in the environment.
