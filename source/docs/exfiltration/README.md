# Introduction

## What?

Data exfiltration is a non-traditional approach for copying and transferring data from a compromised to an 
attacker's machine. The data exfiltration technique is used to emulate the normal network activities, and 
relies on common network protocols such as DNS, HTTP, SSH, etc.

## Why?

Data Exfiltration over common protocols is challenging to detect and distinguish between legitimate and malicious 
traffic.

## How?

* [Network infrastructure](infra.md)
* [Exfiltration using TCP socket](tcp.md)
* [Exfiltration using SSH](ssh.md)
* [Exfiltrate using HTTP(S)](https.md)
* [Exfiltration using ICMP](icmp.md)
* [DNS configurations](dns-conf.md)
* [Exfiltration over DNS](dns.md)
* [DNS tunneling](dns-tunnel.md)
